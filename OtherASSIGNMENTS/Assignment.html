	<a href="Dog.html">SacredDOG</a>
		<p>Here is a quote from Rick Riordan regarding Anpu:</p>
	<blockquote cite="https://www.azquotes.com/quotes/topics/anubis.html">
		"The truth is harsh." Anubis said. "Spirts come to the Hall of Judgement all the time,
		and they cannot let go of their lies.  Tehy deny their faults, their feelings, their mistakes...
		right up until Ammit devours their souls for eternity.  It takes strength & courage to admit truth."
